## üìâ The Problem

Pregnancy is a critical period filled with physical and emotional changes. In Indonesia, this journey is often fraught with significant risks, reflected in a high **Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR)**. According to the 2020 Population Census, the MMR in Indonesia stands at **189 per 100,000 live births**, a figure starkly distant from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target of under 70 per 100,000 by 2030.

Key contributing factors include:
1.  **Delays in Medical Care**: Delays in recognizing danger signs, seeking help, and receiving adequate medical services.
2.  **Socio-Economic Barriers**: Poverty and remote locations limit access to essential health information and services.
3.  **Lack of Health Education**: Insufficient knowledge about pregnancy danger signs and the importance of routine check-ups.
4.  **Mental Health Risks**: Hormonal fluctuations can lead to anxiety, stress, and perinatal depression, which are often overlooked but contribute to maternal health risks.

Without effective intervention, these challenges not only threaten the mother's life but also impact the long-term health of the child, contributing to issues like stunting.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the MomCare prototype on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:
-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Python 3.8+** and **pip**: For the backend server.
-   **MySQL Server**: As the primary database.
-   **Flutter SDK**: For running the mobile application.
-   **An IDE/Code Editor**: Such as VS Code, Android Studio.

### Installation & Setup

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yonurhan/MomCare.git](https://github.com/yonurhan/MomCare.git)
cd MomCare
```

#### **2. Backend Setup** ‚öôÔ∏è

The backend is a Flask server that powers the application's logic and AI features.

-   **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

-   **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

-   **Install Python dependencies:**
    This command installs all required libraries from `requirements.txt` and downloads necessary NLTK data.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python nltk_setup.py
    ```

-   **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) and fill in your details.
    ```
    # .env file for the backend
    DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<dbname>"
    SECRET_KEY="your_strong_secret_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
    ```

-   **Set up the MySQL Database:**
    Ensure your MySQL server is running. Then, apply the database migrations.
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```

-   **Run the Flask Server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### **3. Frontend Setup** üì±

The frontend is a Flutter application for iOS and Android.

-   **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the root MomCare directory
    cd frontend
    ```

-   **Configure the API Base URL:**
    1.  Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` directory.
    2.  Find your computer's local IPv4 address.
        -   On **Windows**, run `ipconfig`.
        -   On **macOS/Linux**, run `ifconfig` or `ip addr`.
    3.  Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing the IP address with your own. The port should match your running Flask server (default is 5000).
        ```
        # .env file for the frontend
        BaseURL=[http://192.168.1.10:5000](http://192.168.1.10:5000)
        ```
        *Note: Do not use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` if you plan to run the app on a physical mobile device.*

-   **Install Flutter dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

-   **Run the Flutter Application:**
    Make sure an emulator is running or a physical device is connected.
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
